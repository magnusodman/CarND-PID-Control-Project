The proportional part of the controller (K_p) make the car follow the road according to CTE (Cross Track Error). A large K_p makes the PID responsive but makes it more likely to overshooting and oscillations. 

The differential part (K_d) dampens the proportional to CTE change rate. This will supress the oscillations and overshoot from a large K_d.

The integrating part of the PID helps out when there are systematic errors in the system (When the wheels are not perfectly aligned or systematic errors in the sensors).

My hyperparameters made the car go straight and stable for the most part. It could start to oscillate a little in the curves and some places along the track where I suspect that some nonlinear CTE measurements where encountered.

I found an algorithm online that I tried succesfully. 

1. Set all gains to 0.
2. Increase K_d until the car start to oscillate.
3. Reduce K_d with a factor 2.
4. Set K_p to to 1 % of K_d.
5. Increase until the car start to oscillate.
6. Reduce K_p by a factor 2.
7. Set K_i to 1 % of K_p.
8. Increase K_i until oscillations start.
9. Decrease K_i by a factor 2.

Using this algorithm and some additional manual tuning I ended up with my final parameters:

K_p = 0.1
K_d = 1.0
K_i = 0.001
